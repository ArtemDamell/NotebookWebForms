# Пхоне book WebForms
## The phone book application was developed by me on WebForms for a channel subscriber in 2020.

This code appears to be an ASP.NET web page that displays a list of contacts from a database. It includes a search box to filter the list by the contact's first name. The list of contacts is displayed using an ASP.NET Repeater control, with each contact displayed in a table row that includes their first name, second name, last name, birthday, phone number, and email address. Each row also includes links to edit or delete the contact.
